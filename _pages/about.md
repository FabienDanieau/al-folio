I am a Researcher at [InterDigital](https://www.interdigital.com). I use virtual reality to enhance the cinematographic experience. In particular I study the impact of haptics and embodiment on the user experience. Before that I was researcher at Technicolor where I studied the use of new sensorial feedback to enhance the audiovisual experience. My main research interests include Haptics, Human Computer Interactions, Virtual Reality, Multimedia, User Experience.

I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Rennes in February 2014. This PhD, entitled "Contribution to the Study of Haptic Feedback for Improving the AudioVisual experience, was conducted under the french CIFRE program (industrial agreement of training through research) and involve a public research laboratory ([Inria Hybrid team](https://team.inria.fr/hybrid)), Inria, Rennes, France) and a private company ([Technicolor](https://www.technicolor.com)). I have been awarded the first prize of the Fondation Rennes 1, édition 2014 for this thesis.

In July 2010 I received an Engineer Degree from the [Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Cognitique](http://www.ensc.fr) (Bordeaux, France). This course aims to study the impact of the human factor in complex systems.
